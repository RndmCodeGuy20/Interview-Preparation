You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a **subsequence** of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** sum.

Return _**any** such subsequence as an integer array of length_ `k`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,1,3,3\], k = 2
**Output:** \[3,3\]
**Explanation:**
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,-2,3,4\], k = 3
**Output:** \[-1,3,4\]
**Explanation:** 
The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,3,3\], k = 2
**Output:** \[3,4\]
**Explanation:**
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
Another possible subsequence is \[4, 3\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-105Â <= nums[i] <= 105`
*   `1 <= k <= nums.length`
